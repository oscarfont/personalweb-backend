 * CryptoAdapter class
 * ====================
 * @description
 * Adapter Pattern applied to the cryptography details.
 * This class works as a wrapper of the crytpography library.
 * Currently uses node:crytpo, however if the library is wanted to be changed, 
 * the only file needed to modify is this adapter class and the code would still work.
