 * ====================
 * @description
 * Adapter Pattern applied to the logger details.
 * This class works as a wrapper of the nodemailer library.
 * Currently uses Nodemailer, however if the library is wanted to be changed, 
 * the only file needed to modify is this adapter class and the code would still work.
